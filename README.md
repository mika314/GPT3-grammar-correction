# GPT3 is the best grammar checker out there!
BASH script which grammar corrects selected texts and pastes it back
## Setup
You need an OPEN AI key and you need to put it in the `~/.gpt3/key.sh` file, the content of the file should look like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

OPENAI_API_KEY=[open AI key]
```
Set up the script to run on the keyboard shortcut. I set it up to `Win-E`. `E` stands for English.
